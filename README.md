There are many challenges to building human settlements on Mars. The most
efficient launch opportunity windows only arise every 2.2 years when Mars is
closest to Earth. Best journey times are 3-6 months. The atmosphere is
primarily CO2, and it is very cold.

Once we have figured out how to get there and how to reliably support human
life (some are aiming for this decade), questions of quality of life become
relevant. This includes producing water and food, staying fit and healthy,
socialising and entertainment. Normal things humans like to do.

One of the resources we have come to take for granted is access to the
internet. Whether to look up information, send email or watch a video, internet
access is now fundamental to modern life. However, all of these services are
based on Earth. The internet was designed based on a number of assumptions that
will no longer be true if we want to offer the same experience to citizens of
Mars.

In this article we examine those assumptions, discuss the challenges and
consider possible solutions to setting up the internet on Mars. [Read on the
