There are many challenges to building human settlements on Mars. The most efficient launch opportunity windows when Mars is closest to Earth only arise every 2.2 years. Best journey times are 3-6 months. The atmosphere is primarily CO2, and it is very cold.

Once we have figured out how to get there and how to reliably support human life (some are aiming for this decade), questions of quality of life become relevant. This includes producing water and food, staying fit and healthy, socialising and entertainment. Normal things humans like to do.

One of the resources we have come to take for granted is access to the internet. Whether to look up information, send email or watch a video, internet access is now fundamental to modern life. However, all of these services are based on Earth. The internet was designed based on a number of assumptions that will no longer be true if we want to offer the same experience to citizens of Mars.
